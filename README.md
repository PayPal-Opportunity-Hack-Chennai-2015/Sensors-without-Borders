## Problem description

Buliding a community engagement model for volunteers involved in various deployment and maintenance activities for Sensors that measure pollution levels.

## The primary componenets of the system:

* Tracking system (getting to know who has done what)
* Reward system (when volunteers successfully complete they are rewarded for their efforts)

## Proposed Solution

1. We are following two pronged approach here
2. We are creating a dashboard for the users where the user/admin can see the upcoming tasks, completed status,       current karma points and associated rewards
3. Using the open source comm care mobile + backend app for creating custom forms for volunteer activity tracking.

### Technology Stack

1. Nodejs
2. MongoDB
3. CommCare
